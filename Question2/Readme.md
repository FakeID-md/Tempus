Overview
==============

In mathematics, operators are written in-between their operands. This is how we normally write expressions. An expression such as A - ( B + C ) / D is usually taken to mean something like: "First add B and C together, then substract the sum of from A, then divide by D."

In programming language like Julia, we can define our own operator. In this program, I defined my own infix operator ```âŠ•``` that takes two functions as input and returns the composite value of two functions.
